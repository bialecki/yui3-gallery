Effects is meant to bring the concise API seen in Scriptaculous and other
animation libraries to YUI while also leveraging the great YUI 3 Anim module.

Version 0.6
-----------

Refactored events so that now you can move easily subscribe to two sets of events: setup and
finish.  The most common use case by far will be finish (in fact it may be the only important
one), but you have access to either.

Version 0.5
-----------

This is the first official version and includes basic support for all of the core
Scriptaculous effects as well as some of the more complex ones.  I plan on releasing
this as version 1.0 once all of the Scriptaculous effects have been ported over and
the documentation is complete.  Stay tuned!
